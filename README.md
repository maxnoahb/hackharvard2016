This is a website created during a Fall 2016 hackathon aimed at filling sustenance needs for college students. The website uses the Edamam recipe search API, prompting the user for ingredients they have on hand, and returns a list of recipes the user can make with those ingredients. Links take the user to sites around the web with the corresponding recipe. There is also a map function, using the Google Maps API, that pins the nearest grocery stores and farmer's markets using geolocation.
